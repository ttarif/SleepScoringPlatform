# EDF File Combiner

This Python script allows you to combine multiple EDF (European Data Format) files into a single EDF file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `mne`: `pip install mne`
  - `pyedflib`: `pip install pyedflib`
  - `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script (`combine_edf_files.py`).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt in this directory.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python combine_edf_files.py
   ```

5. A GUI (Graphical User Interface) window will appear.

6. Click on the "Select Directory and Files" button.

7. Navigate to the directory containing the EDF files you want to combine.

8. Select one or more EDF files.

9. Enter a name for the combined EDF file in the popup window.

10. Click "OK" or press Enter.

11. The script will combine the selected EDF files into a single EDF file with the provided name.

12. The combined EDF file will be saved in the same directory as the original files.

13. Once the process is complete, you will see a confirmation message in the terminal or command prompt.

14. You can find the combined EDF file in the selected directory.

## Notes

- Make sure that all selected EDF files have the same sampling rate and channel configurations.
- The combined EDF file will contain the data from all selected files concatenated together.
- The script uses `mne` and `pyedflib` libraries for handling EDF files.
