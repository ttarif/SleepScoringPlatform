`notebooks/`

This folder contains literate programming documents, e.g. Jupyter or Quarto.

* Notebooks should explain how your pipeline works.
* Text explanations, visualizations, and sample code are ideal.
* Long-running operations (e.g., data downloads, model fitting) should go in pipeline scripts so notebooks can render quickly.
